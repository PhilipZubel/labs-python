Python Lab: Glasgow Adventures üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø
Introduction:
Welcome to the Glasgow Python Lab! Today, we'll dive into the exciting world of Python statements and expressions through Glasgow-themed stories and exercises.

Statements and Expressions:
Statements in Python are instructions that perform actions, and expressions are combinations of values and operators that can be evaluated.

Story 1: The Bagpipe Player üé∂
Imagine you are in the heart of Glasgow, surrounded by the sounds of bagpipes. Let's use Python to express the joy of playing the bagpipes!

python
Copy code
# Expression: Combine strings to create a message
bagpipe_message = "I love the sound of " + "bagpipes!"

# Statement: Print the message
print(bagpipe_message)
Exercise 1:
Complete the code to print: "Glasgow is known for its lively music and the sound of bagpipes!"

Story 2: The Glasgow Weather ‚òî
Glasgow is famous for its ever-changing weather. Let's use Python to express the excitement of checking the weather.

python
Copy code
# Expression: Combine a string and a variable
weather_condition = "rainy"
weather_message = "The weather in Glasgow is " + weather_condition + " today."

# Statement: Print the weather message
print(weather_message)
Exercise 2:
Change the weather_condition variable to "sunny" and print the updated message.

Conclusion:
Statements and expressions are powerful tools in Python, allowing us to create dynamic and engaging stories like our Glasgow adventures.

Feel free to customize the stories and exercises based on your preferences. This structure provides a blend of storytelling, explanation, and hands-on exercises to make learning Python more enjoyable for beginners.
