Deception Technology for Phishing Response: Set up a deception-based defense system where phishing emails are rerouted to a sandbox environment, which simulates an actual userâ€™s behavior. Here, the sandbox interacts with the phishing link or attachment to identify its intent. This would allow the cybersecurity team to see how the phishing attack would behave without risking user data, helping to analyze tactics and adjust defense strategies.
