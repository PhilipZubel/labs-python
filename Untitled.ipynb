    "### If Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, an \"if statement\" is a fundamental control structure that allows you to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions. It lets you execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple explanation of how an if statement works, along with some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Basic Syntax:\n",
    "The basic syntax of an if statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # code to execute if the condition is true \n",
    "```\n",
    "In this structure, condition is an expression that evaluates to either True or False. If the condition is True, the indented code block beneath the if statement is executed. If the condition is False, the code block is skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 1: Checking a Number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "number = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "if number > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is greater than 5.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the condition number > 5 is true, so the indented code block beneath the if statement is executed, and the message is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 2: User Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "user_input = input(\"Enter a number: \")\n",
    "user_number = int(user_input)\n",
    "\n",
    "if user_number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The entered number is even.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The entered number is odd.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the program takes user input, converts it to an integer, and then checks if it's an even or odd number using the % (modulo) operator. The else statement is used to provide an alternative message if the condition is not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: Multiple Conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "if age < 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are a minor.\")\n",
    "elif age >= 18 and age < 21:\n",
    "    print(\"You are legally an adult but can't drink.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are a legal adult.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses the if, elif (short for \"else if\"), and else statements to check multiple conditions. The program prints a different message based on the age of the person."

    "### Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A `for` loop in programming is used to repeatedly execute a block of code for a specified number of times. The `range()` function is often used in conjunction with for loops to define the range of values that the loop should iterate over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the basic structure of a for loop using range():\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for variable in range(start, stop, step):\n",
    "    # Code to be repeated\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- variable: This is a variable that takes on each value in the specified range during each iteration of the loop.\n",
    "- start: The starting value of the range (inclusive). If not provided, it defaults to 0.\n",
    "- stop: The end value of the range (exclusive). The loop will continue until it reaches this value.\n",
    "- step: The step or increment between values in the range. If not provided, it defaults to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's go through a simple example to illustrate the concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Print numbers from 0 to 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "for number in range(5):\n",
    "    print(number)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- variable is number.\n",
    "- start is not provided (default is 0).\n",
    "- stop is 5, but the loop stops when it reaches 4 (exclusive).\n",
    "- step is not provided (default is 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop will execute five times, and during each iteration, the variable number will take on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The `print(number)` statement inside the loop will then print these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `range()` with all three arguments (start, stop, and step). Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Print even numbers from 2 to 10\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for even_number in range(2, 11, 2):\n",
    "    print(even_number)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- variable is even_number.\n",
    "- start is 2.\n",
    "- stop is 11, but the loop stops when it reaches 10 (exclusive).\n",
    "- step is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop will print even numbers from 2 to 10 in steps of 2 during each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a for loop with `range()` allows you to repeat a block of code a specified number of times, and the `range()` function defines the range of values for the loop to iterate over."

    "### While loop\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's delve into the concept of a while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Code to be executed while the condition is true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop starts by checking the specified condition.\n",
    "If the condition is true, the code inside the loop is executed.\n",
    "After each iteration, the condition is checked again.\n",
    "The loop continues executing as long as the condition remains true.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 1: Counting Down\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "countdown = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "while countdown > 0:\n",
    "    print(countdown)\n",
    "    countdown -= 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# 5\n",
    "# 4\n",
    "# 3\n",
    "# 2\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the loop starts with countdown set to 5. The loop continues to execute as long as countdown is greater than 0. In each iteration, it prints the current value of countdown and then decrements it by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 2: User Input Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "user_input = \"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "while user_input.lower() != \"quit\":\n",
    "    user_input = input(\"Enter a value (type 'quit' to exit): \")\n",
    "    print(f\"You entered: {user_input}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop continues until the user enters 'quit'\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the loop keeps prompting the user for input until they enter the word \"quit.\" The loop's condition checks if the lowercase version of user_input is not equal to \"quit.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 3: Sum of Even Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "number = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "while number <= 10:\n",
    "    total += number\n",
    "    number += 2\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"The sum of even numbers from 2 to 10 is: {total}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the loop calculates the sum of even numbers from 2 to 10. It starts with number set to 2, and in each iteration, it adds the current value of number to the total and increments number by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 4: Infinite Loop Caution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Uncomment and run the following code cautiously; it creates an infinite loop:\n",
    " \n",
    "```\n",
    "# while True:\n",
    "#     print(\"This is an infinite loop!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code creates an infinite loop that prints a message. Infinite loops should be avoided unless intentionally used, as they can lead to programs becoming unresponsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tips for Using while Loops:\n",
    "- Ensure there's a mechanism within the loop to change the condition eventually.\n",
    "- Test your loop with different input values to ensure it behaves as expected.\n",
    "- Understanding while loops is fundamental for programming, as they provide a way to repeat actions based on certain conditions."
